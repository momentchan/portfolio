summary:
  'A global participatory artwork where people draw flowers from home and see them bloom together in
  real time across YouTube Live—turning the television into a shared digital canvas during
  isolation.'
---

Created during the COVID-19 pandemic, this project transforms isolation into connection by inviting
people around the world to draw a flower and upload it from home. Each flower—whether drawn on
paper, phone, or computer—appears and scatters in real time on a YouTube Live stream, forming a
constantly evolving artwork.

When displayed on a home television, the screen becomes a living artwork that blends personal
expression with global presence. The town of each contributor is shown as new flowers appear,
highlighting our shared existence across distance. Participants can also download a custom artwork
combining their flower with others from around the world.

The piece celebrates collective memory, turning a moment of global crisis into a blooming symbol of
connection, resilience, and remembrance.
