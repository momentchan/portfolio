  summary: `A global participatory artwork where people draw flowers from home and see them bloom together in real time across YouTube Live—turning the television into a shared digital canvas during isolation.`,
  description: `Created during the COVID-19 pandemic, this project transforms isolation into connection by inviting people around the world to draw a flower and upload it from home. Each flower—whether drawn on paper, phone, or computer—appears and scatters in real time on a YouTube Live stream, forming a constantly evolving artwork.
  
  When displayed on a home television, the screen becomes a living artwork that blends personal expression with global presence. The town of each contributor is shown as new flowers appear, highlighting our shared existence across distance. Participants can also download a custom artwork combining their flower with others from around the world.
  
  The piece celebrates collective memory, turning a moment of global crisis into a blooming symbol of connection, resilience, and remembrance.`,
