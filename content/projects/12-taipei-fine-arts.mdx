summary:
  "A dynamic visual identity for Taipei Fine Arts Museum's 40th anniversary that merges the concept
  of evolution with the architectural forms of its old and new buildings."
---

To celebrate its 40th anniversary and the expansion of a new underground building, the Taipei Fine
Arts Museum commissioned a dynamic logo that symbolizes this pivotal moment of growth. The design
uses a bold black-and-white split "40" to represent both cellular division and the contrasting forms
of the museum's architecture—the square of the original building and the circle of the new one.

Through eight different visual techniques and materials, the logo expresses the museum's transition
into a more interdisciplinary and future-oriented institution. The result is a visual identity that
not only marks an important milestone but also reflects the merging of urban, natural, and artistic
elements in the museum's next chapter.
