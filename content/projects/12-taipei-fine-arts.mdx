summary:
  "A dynamic visual identity for Taipei Fine Arts Museum's 40th anniversary that merges the concept
  of evolution with the architectural forms of its old and new buildings."
---

To celebrate its 40th anniversary and the expansion of a new underground building, the Taipei Fine
Arts Museum commissioned a dynamic logo symbolizing a pivotal moment of growth. The black-and-white
split "40" represents cellular division and the contrasting architectural forms—square (original
building) and circle (new extension).

Across eight visual techniques and materials, the identity becomes a flexible system rather than a
single mark—capable of adapting to various media while preserving conceptual clarity. The visual
identity not only marks an important milestone but also reflects the merging of urban, natural, and
artistic elements in the museum's next chapter.
