At Expo 2025 Osaka, I collaborated with ifplus as a technical artist to reimagine the language of
semiconductors through interactive design.

We created a 14-meter-long tech wall, exhibited at the Taiwan Pavilion (Tech World), designed to
transform circuit diagrams into gesture-responsive light and motion.

### Interaction

As visitors approach, pulses of light simulate the flow of signals within a chip—turning invisible
computation into a tangible, intuitive experience. It's a chance not just to look at technology, but
to reach out and feel it respond.

### Visual System

A wall made of signals and light. Each square is part of a larger visual system, inspired by
semiconductor circuit layouts and designed to respond to human gestures. Zoom in, scroll across, and
you’ll see how movement and light come together.

- Circuit layouts set the structure.
- Noise adds a bit of movement and unpredictability.
- Thin-film effects bring shifting colors.
- Generative lights add subtle rhythm and motion.
- Emissive elements give the whole thing its brightness and energy.
