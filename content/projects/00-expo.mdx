## Overview

For **Expo 2025 Osaka**, I collaborated with ifplus as a **Technical Artist** to reimagine the
visual language of semiconductors through interactive design.

Installed in the Taiwan Pavilion (Tech World), the **14-meter wall** converts circuit diagrams into
dynamic light paths that react to visitor movement in real time.

### The Experience

As people approach, pulses of light simulate signal flow inside a chipâ€”turning abstract computation
into a physical, intuitive experience.

Rather than simply looking at technology, visitors are invited to reach out and feel it respond,
bridging the gap between complex systems and human perception.

### Impact

The installation successfully demystifies semiconductor technology by creating an emotional
connection between visitors and the invisible digital world that powers modern life.
