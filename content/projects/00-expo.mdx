  summary:
    'An interactive 14m tech wall that turns semiconductor circuits into gesture-responsive light and motion.',
  description: `For Expo 2025 Osaka, I collaborated with ifplus as a Technical Artist to reimagine the visual language of semiconductors through interactive design. Installed in the Taiwan Pavilion (Tech World), the 14-meter wall converts circuit diagrams into dynamic light paths that react to visitor movement in real time.
  
  As people approach, pulses of light simulate signal flow inside a chipâ€”turning abstract computation into a physical, intuitive experience. Rather than simply looking at technology, visitors are invited to reach out and feel it respond, bridging the gap between complex systems and human perception.`,
