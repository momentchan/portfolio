The first-ever Taiwan Design Week was held in Taipei under the theme Elastic Bridging, focusing on
sustainability and innovation. Organized by the Taiwan Design Research Institute (TDRI), the event
featured exhibitions, forums, and an awards ceremony across the city's historical district.

In the main exhibition area E: Imagination Cloud, which highlighted multimedia and interactive
works, Bito presented an installation titled "What is your belief?" The piece began with a simple
question and reclassified the studio's works based on different belief systems. Visitors were then
invited to reflect on their own beliefs through an interactive social media experience.

By merging digital interaction, design thinking, and personal reflection, the installation
transformed belief into a participatory dialogue between audience and artwork.
