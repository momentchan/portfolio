  summary:
    'An audio-reactive visual piece using particles, lighting, and live MIDI control to create dynamic atmosphere in real time.',
  description: `Rebirth is a live audio-visual piece that uses real-time performance to shape motion, atmosphere, and narrative. A rabbit runs through the streets of Tokyo while particles flow around it, dynamically reacting to the music. Lighting and environmental changes are controlled through a MIDI controller, allowing visuals and sound to evolve together.
  
  By combining audio arrangement with live VJ performance, the project creates an immersive storytelling experienceâ€”merging character, rhythm, and urban energy into a synchronized visual journey.`,
