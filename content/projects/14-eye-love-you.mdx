summary:
  'A web experiment where particle collisions create sound and live camera input lights the scene.'
---

This browser-based piece simulates bouncing particles, turning each collision into musical chords.
It also uses real-time camera input as environmental lighting, allowing virtual objects to react to
the user's surroundings and blending physics, sound, and reality.
