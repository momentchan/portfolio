    'An immersive web piece using React, GPGPU particles, and AI-generated text/voice to create a living, evolving narrative.',
  description: `Drift is an immersive web experience about a once idealistic astronaut who becomes stranded in the endless void of space after a failed mission. Unable to return to Earth, he begins writing daily diaries—capturing fragments of thought, memory, and emotion as his only remaining connection to the past. 
  Built with React and GPGPU-powered particle simulation, the project visualizes his mental state as a living field of drifting particles that evolve in real time. Each day, AI-generated text and voice unfold based on his internal condition, forming a shifting portrait of isolation, reflection, and fading hope.  
  AI here is not just a tool, but part of the narrative. Carefully crafted prompts maintain thematic consistency while allowing unpredictability—embracing the imperfect, unstable nature of memory. The project also explores how web technology can express atmosphere and emotion, blurring the boundary between user, interface, and character. `,
