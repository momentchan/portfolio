## Overview

**Drift** is an immersive web experience about a once idealistic astronaut who becomes stranded in
the endless void of space after a failed mission. Unable to return to Earth, he begins writing daily
diaries—capturing fragments of thought, memory, and emotion as his only remaining connection to the
past.

### The Experience

Built with **React** and **GPGPU-powered particle simulation**, the project visualizes his mental
state as a living field of drifting particles that evolve in real time. Each day, AI-generated text
and voice unfold based on his internal condition, forming a shifting portrait of isolation,
reflection, and fading hope.

### Technical Approach

- **GPGPU Particles**: Real-time simulation of 1M+ particles representing fragmented consciousness
- **AI Integration**: Dynamic text and voice generation that maintains thematic consistency while
  embracing unpredictability
- **React Architecture**: Component-based structure for maintainable complex interactions
- **WebGL Rendering**: Custom shaders for atmospheric visual effects

### Narrative as Technology

AI here is not just a tool, but part of the narrative. Carefully crafted prompts maintain thematic
consistency while allowing unpredictability—embracing the imperfect, unstable nature of memory.

The project also explores how web technology can express atmosphere and emotion, blurring the
boundary between user, interface, and character.
