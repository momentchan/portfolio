Drift is an immersive web experience about a once idealistic and highly accomplished astronaut who,
after a failed mission, becomes lost in the vastness of space and unable to return to Earth. In
isolation and regret, he records daily struggles, small breakthroughs, losses, and thoughts of
family and friends in his diary—capturing fragments of thought, memory, and emotion.

### The Experience

The project visualizes his mental state as a living field of drifting particles that evolve in real
time. Each day, AI-generated text and voice unfold based on his internal condition, forming a
shifting portrait of isolation, reflection, and fading hope.

### Technical Approach

- **GPGPU Particles**: Real-time simulation of 1M+ particles representing fragmented consciousness
- **AI Integration**: Dynamic text and voice generation that maintains thematic consistency while
  embracing unpredictability
- **React Architecture**: Component-based structure for maintainable complex interactions
- **WebGL Rendering**: Custom shaders for atmospheric visual effects

### Narrative as Technology

AI here is not just a tool, but part of the narrative. Carefully designed prompts preserve the core
concept while embracing randomness and non-repeatability—maintaining thematic consistency while
accepting the imperfect, unstable nature of memory.

The project also explores how web technology can express atmosphere and emotion, blurring the
boundary between user, interface, and character. By combining real-time particles, AI-driven text
and voice, and a restrained interaction model, Drift frames technology as a vehicle for interior
storytelling—using the browser to evoke isolation, resilience, and the fragile continuity of
thought.
