summary:
  'An audio-reactive visual piece using particles, lighting, and live MIDI control to create dynamic
  atmosphere in real time.'
---

Rebirth is a live audio-visual piece that uses real-time performance to shape motion, atmosphere,
and narrative. A rabbit runs through the streets of Tokyo while particles flow around it,
dynamically reacting to the music. Lighting and environmental changes are controlled through a MIDI
controller, allowing visuals and sound to evolve together.

By combining audio arrangement with live VJ performance, the project creates an immersive
storytelling experienceâ€”merging character, rhythm, and urban energy into a synchronized visual
journey.
