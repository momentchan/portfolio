Catching and Collecting in the Sacred Forest is a physical interactive space where extinct and
endangered animals move freely. Visitors use their smartphones to locate animals, shoot Study Arrows
or drop Study Nets to capture them, and build a personal collection book.

Animals react to touch and can be released back into the environmentâ€”the more animals are collected,
the more knowledge is revealed. The shared space encourages cooperation and curiosity, turning
observation into hands-on exploration. This approach transforms learning into playful discovery,
connecting visitors emotionally to endangered species and their stories.
