  summary:
    'An immersive learning installation where visitors use smartphones to discover, capture, and release animals, turning exploration into playful education.',
  description: `Catching and Collecting in the Sacred Forest is a physical interactive space where extinct and endangered animals move freely. Visitors use their smartphones to locate animals, shoot Study Arrows or drop Study Nets to capture them, and build a personal collection book.
  
  Animals react to touch, can be released back into the environment, and reveal more information the more they are collected. By combining movement, collaboration, and digital collection, the experience transforms learning into exploration and play.`,
