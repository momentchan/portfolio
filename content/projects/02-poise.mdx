  summary: `An interactive visual piece using ballet-inspired motion and layered timing to explore how movement leaves traces and becomes memory.`,
  description: `This project investigates the idea that movement is never singularâ€”it overlaps, lingers, and reshapes itself through time. Some frames emerge sharply, capturing a moment with clarity, while others remain faint, quietly filling the spaces in between and allowing the flow to continue.
    
    Ballet becomes the ideal metaphor: every gesture carries the echo of what came before, transitioning between precision and softness. The work visualizes this layered temporality, treating motion not just as a sequence, but as a memory that accumulates in space.`,
