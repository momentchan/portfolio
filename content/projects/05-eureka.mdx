  summary:
    'An interactive visual installation that brings underwater and sea-surface light spheres to life through gentle, real-time guest interaction.',
  description: `EUREKA is a real-time interactive art piece designed to create a sensory experience within a restaurant space. The installation presents two connected visual scenes—one underwater and one on the sea surface—where light spheres move gently through the environment.
  
  Guest interactions in the space, such as opening the refrigerator door, quietly trigger the spheres to rise, simulating the feeling of bubbles or shifting currents. Over time, the visuals evolve with the atmosphere of the room, capturing the gradual rhythm of presence, motion, and changing perception.
  
  Rather than focusing on obvious interaction, the piece integrates input seamlessly into the environment—allowing technology, space, and human behavior to merge into a calm, immersive experience.`,
