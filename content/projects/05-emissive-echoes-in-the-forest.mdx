  summary:
    'An audio-reactive visual piece where glowing Pikachu-faced spheres float through a realistic forest, blurring the line between the natural and the surreal.',
  description: `Emissive Echoes in the Forest explores the tension between realism and surrealism through sound-driven motion. Set in a lush, lifelike forest, glowing spheres with Pikachu-like faces drift through the air, their emissive light pulsing in sync with audio.
  
  Rather than simply animating to rhythm, the work uses sound to shape atmosphereâ€”turning a peaceful natural scene into something playful, uncanny, and dreamlike. By merging familiar characters, realistic environments, and abstract audio reactivity, the piece transforms the forest into a living stage where fantasy and reality coexist.`,
