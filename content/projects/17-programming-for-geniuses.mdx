  summary:
    'An interactive installation where children draw characters and bring them to life through block-based programming in a shared digital playground.',
  description: `Play! Programming for Geniuses is a teamLab interactive installation that teaches the fundamentals of programming through play. Children draw characters, create simple programs using block-based logic on a tablet, and watch their drawings come alive in a large shared grass-field projection.
  
  Each character follows the programmed instructions and interacts with other childrenâ€™s creations, encouraging creativity, logical thinking, and collaboration. By turning programming into a visual and playful experience, the installation helps children intuitively understand algorithms, expression, and the power of technology in an engaging and accessible way.`,
