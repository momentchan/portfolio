BUNNY RUNNING reimagines the excitement of receiving a package as a fully immersive installation at
Taiwan's Lantern Festival. Set within the evolving tradition of the festival—now known for its
fusion of art and technology—the piece follows a brave bunny courier on a narrative-driven journey.

Audiences interacted directly with 3D billboards, triggering hidden treasures inside packages
through discrete sensors. At the climax, the bunny courier delivered the package onto the top of the
screens, creating a surprising moment of direct connection with the crowd.

The installation combined three-story-tall screens, lights, lasers, projections, real-time
interaction, physical props, and music to transform the site into a responsive architectural
environment. By blending storytelling with large-scale visual design and audience participation, the
work created a collective, memorable experience that extended beyond traditional lantern displays.
