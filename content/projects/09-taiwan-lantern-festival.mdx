BUNNY RUNNING reimagines the excitement of receiving a package as a fully immersive installation at
Taiwan's Lantern Festival. Set within the evolving tradition of the festival—now known for its
fusion of art and technology—the piece follows a brave bunny courier on a narrative-driven journey.

Visitors triggered hidden treasures inside packages on 3D billboards via discrete sensors. At the
climax, the bunny delivered the package onto the top of the screens, creating a surprising moment of
direct connection with the crowd. Three-story screens, lights, lasers, projections, real-time
interaction, physical props, and music transformed the site into a responsive architectural
environment—blending storytelling with large-scale visual design and audience participation.
