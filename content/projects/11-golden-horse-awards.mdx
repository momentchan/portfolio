summary:
  "An interactive motion poster using real-time generative code and user-driven brushstrokes to
  transform Paul Chiang's abstract art into a living, cinematic experience."
---

This interactive motion poster was created for the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival, translating
Paul Chiang's abstract paintings into a digital experience. His works—rooted in the light and
atmosphere of Taitung—use shadow, texture, and emotion to reflect the cinematic spirit of the
festival.

On the web, users add brushstrokes and points of light by clicking or touching the screen,
contributing directly to the composition. Each interaction produces real-time generative motion that
remains fluid and non-repetitive. Built with WebGL and Three.js, the system layers custom
shader-driven effects over interactive input to maintain responsiveness while preserving painterly
qualities.

Rather than simply displaying artwork, the poster invites participation—blurring painting,
performance, and interface. It turns the festival's visual identity into an immersive encounter with
abstraction, memory, and the act of seeing.
