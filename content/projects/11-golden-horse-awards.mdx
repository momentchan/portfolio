summary:
  "An interactive motion poster using real-time generative code and user-driven brushstrokes to
  transform Paul Chiang's abstract art into a living, cinematic experience."
---

This interactive motion poster was created for the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival, translating
Paul Chiang's abstract paintings into a digital experience. His works—rooted in the light and
atmosphere of Taitung—use shadow, texture, and emotion to reflect the cinematic spirit of the
festival.

To extend this expression beyond a static image, the piece becomes a living poster on the web. Users
can click or touch the screen to add brushstrokes and points of light, contributing directly to the
composition. Each interaction generates real-time visuals through code, producing fluid,
non-repetitive motion that evolves with every input.

Rather than simply displaying artwork, the poster invites participation—blurring painting,
performance, and interface. It turns the festival's visual identity into an immersive encounter with
abstraction, memory, and the act of seeing.
