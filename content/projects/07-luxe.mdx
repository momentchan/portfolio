  "A real-time interactive projection mapping ice show where visuals respond to skaters' movements
  using live tracking."

LUXE is a large-scale ice skating show held at Yokohama Arena in 2021, combining performance and
technology through real-time interactive projection mapping. The production transformed the entire
rink and stage into a responsive canvas synchronized with skaters and dancers.

Performer positions were tracked live, allowing projections to react to every motionâ€”extending
choreography into light and space. Visuals flowed across the full ice surface and large screens,
creating a unified environment that evolved with the performance.

Close collaboration across direction, lighting, sound, sensors, and projection elevated the show
into a cohesive audiovisual experience, demonstrating how interactive technology can amplify the
emotion and precision of live performance.
