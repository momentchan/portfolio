False Earth is an interactive WebGPU experience that continues the journey of Drift—presenting a
continuous landscape generated in real time through GPU-based simulations. Set after the long drift
through space, the project follows an astronaut who arrives on a surface that resembles Earth, yet
does not behave like one.

### The Experience

As the astronaut moves forward, the ground responds and transforms, leaving visible traces across an
endless field. Rather than telling a story through words, the experience unfolds through motion and
change—where distance never closes and the environment reveals its nature only through interaction.
By navigating this unfamiliar terrain, visitors encounter a world that appears stable at first
glance, but gradually exposes uncertain form.

### Technical Approach

- **WebGPU grass**: Compute shaders (TSL) for blade position, Voronoi clumping, wind, terrain
  sampling, and character push—with a stable, tile-free pattern via PCG hash and CPU grid indexing
- **LOD**: Distance-based level of detail with configurable segment counts and draw buffers
- **Procedural terrain**: FBM-based height and normals sampled in compute
- **VAT roses**: Vertex Animation Texture roses with LOD and compute-driven spawn and update
- **Character**: Third-person character with camera modes (Follow / FPV / Detached) and grass push
  interaction
- **Cosmic beams**: Animated beam effects in a separate scene
- **Post-processing**: TSL pipeline with Bloom, DoF, SMAA; PerformanceMonitor for adaptive DPR
