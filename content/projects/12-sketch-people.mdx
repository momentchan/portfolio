  summary:
    'An interactive installation where hand-drawn historical figures come to life, walk around a virtual park, and speak when touched.',
  description: `Sketch Kuroda Kanbei invites participants to draw Kuroda Kanbei and related historical figures on paper. Once scanned, the drawings are brought to life in a large digital park where they walk, dance, and interact in real time.
  
  When visitors touch the characters, they begin to speak, creating a playful connection between history and imagination. By combining hand drawing, animation, and touch-based interaction, the installation turns historical learning into a lively and engaging experience.`,
