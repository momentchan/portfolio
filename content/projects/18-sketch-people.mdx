summary:
  'An interactive installation where hand-drawn historical figures come to life, walk around a
  virtual park, and speak when touched.'
---

Participants draw Kuroda Kanbei and related historical figures on paper. Once scanned, the drawings
come to life in a large digital park where they walk, dance, and interact in real time.

When visitors touch the characters, they begin to speakâ€”creating a playful connection between
history and imagination. By combining hand drawing, animation, and touch-based interaction, the
installation turns historical learning into a lively and engaging experience.
