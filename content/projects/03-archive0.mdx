  summary: `Interactive, time-reactive posters built with React, Three.js, and a single GLSL shader to explore glitch, memory, and organic imperfection.`,
  description: `ARCHIVE:0 is a collection of browser-based posters that respond in real time to both time and user interaction. Inspired by Mike Lemanski’s Twilight Zone posters, the project investigates how code can create organic imperfection—visuals that feel unstable, alive, and constantly in motion.
  Each poster appears like a fragmented signal: glitching, fading, and layered with soft noise, as if pulled from a synthetic archive—corrupted logs, lost memories, or failed reconstructions from a machine attempting to remember.
  
  Despite their shifting moods, every visual is generated from the same GLSL-based system, proving that a single shader can produce a wide emotional range through parameter variation. The entire experience runs fully in-browser, using React and Three.js to deliver real-time generative storytelling through motion, distortion, and digital decay.`,
