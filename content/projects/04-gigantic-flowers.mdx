Proliferating Immense Life – A Whole Year per Year is an interactive installation from teamLab's
Spirits of the Flowers series. In real-time, flowers emerge, bloom, decay, and disappear according
to the actual seasons, forming a continuous cycle of life and death.

Viewers can touch the flowers to make them fall and die, while the work is influenced by surrounding
artworks—creating a living ecosystem of change. Using teamLab's "Ultrasubjective Space," the artwork
flattens perspective without fixing the viewer's viewpoint.

The flowers extend beyond screen boundaries, merging with the physical venue and the viewer's body.
This creates an environment where life, time, and human presence are deeply interconnected.
