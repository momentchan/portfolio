  summary:
    'An interactive installation where flowers bloom and decay with the seasons, reacting to touch and merging the digital world with physical space.',
  description: `Proliferating Immense Life – A Whole Year per Year is an interactive installation from teamLab’s Spirits of the Flowers series. In real-time, flowers emerge, bloom, decay, and disappear according to the actual seasons, forming a continuous cycle of life and death.
  
  When viewers touch the flowers, they fall and die, and the work is also influenced by other surrounding artworks, creating a living ecosystem of change. Using teamLab’s “Ultrasubjective Space,” the artwork flattens perspective without fixing the viewer’s viewpoint. Instead of being confined to a screen or wall, the flowers spread beyond boundaries, allowing the artwork to merge seamlessly with the physical space and the viewer’s body.
  
  By combining seasonal transformation, interactive behavior, and spatial continuity, the installation creates an environment where life, time, and human presence are deeply interconnected.`,
