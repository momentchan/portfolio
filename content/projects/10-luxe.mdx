  summary:
    'A real-time interactive projection mapping ice show where visuals respond to skaters’ movements using live tracking.',
  description: `LUXE is a large-scale ice skating show held at Yokohama Arena in 2021, combining performance and technology through real-time interactive projection mapping. Our team created immersive visuals across the full ice rink and large screens, synchronizing the environment with the movements of skaters and dancers.
  
  By tracking performer positions in real time, the projections reacted dynamically to every motion, enhancing choreography and transforming the ice into a living stage. The production involved close collaboration across multiple teams—direction, lighting, sound, sensors, and projection—showcasing how interactive technology can elevate live performance into a unified audiovisual experience.`,
