  summary: `A web-based interaction that transforms typed text into physics-driven 3D objects, showcasing how real-time simulation and creativity can live directly in the browser.`,
  description: `This project explores the potential of modern web technology by turning keyboard input into dynamic, physical objects that users can scroll, collide, and interact with in real time. Built with WebGL, it supports smooth rendering, physics simulation, and visual customization—even on mobile devices.
  
  Coming from a background in large-scale physical installations, I wanted to bring the same sense of play and immersion to a browser-based experience that anyone can access. With today’s web capabilities rivaling game engines, creativity—not platform—is the real limit. This experiment celebrates that shift and the exciting possibilities of interactive WebGL.`,
