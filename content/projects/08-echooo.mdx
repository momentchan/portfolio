summary:
  'A large-scale interactive audiovisual performance where projection mapping and real-time input
  from viewers transform the exterior of the New Taipei City Art Museum.'

ECHOOO was created for the 2023 Taiwan Design Expo as an outdoor interactive projection on the New
Taipei City Art Museum. The visual content reinterprets the city's culture and natural landscape
through motion graphics and trompe l'oeil effects, turning the building's rigid architecture into
soft, flowing forms at night.

Audience participation is central to the experience. A large touch-sensitive light device in the
viewing area allows viewers to alter the visuals in real time, expanding the range of motion and
dynamic effects. The more people interact, the more the projection evolves—making every performance
unique and collectively shaped by the crowd.

By merging projection mapping, sound, and physical interaction, the work transforms the museum
façade into a living canvas and turns spectators into co-creators.
