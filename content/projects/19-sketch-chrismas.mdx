  summary: `An interactive Christmas installation where children's drawings of Santa, cars, and buildings come to life and move through a shared digital town.`,
  description: `Sketch Christmas brings a festive world to life through children’s drawings. Participants draw Santa Claus or elements of the town—such as cars, buildings, and decorations—on paper. Once scanned, the drawings appear in a large digital town and begin to move and interact in real time.
  
  As more children add their creations, the town continuously evolves, becoming unique with each session. The installation also allows direct interaction—touching a car makes it speed up, and various elements respond dynamically. By combining drawing, animation, and play, the work transforms imagination into a lively Christmas experience.`,
