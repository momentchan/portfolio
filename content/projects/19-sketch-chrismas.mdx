summary:
  "An interactive Christmas installation where children's drawings of Santa, cars, and buildings
  come to life and move through a shared digital town."
---

Participants draw Santa Claus or elements of the town—cars, buildings, decorations—on paper. After
scanning, drawings appear in a large digital town and move in real time.

As more creations are added, the town evolves uniquely with each session. Touching a car makes it
speed up, and other elements respond dynamically, transforming imagination into a lively Christmas
experience.
